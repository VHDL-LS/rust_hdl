# Overview
This repository contains a fast VHDL language server and analysis library written in Rust.

The speed makes the tool very pleasant to use since it loads projects really fast and does not consume a lot of ram.
A 200.000 line VHDL project is analyzed in 160 ms on my Desktop using 8 cores and only consumes 180 MByte of RAM when loaded. 

I very much appreciate help from other people especially regarding semantic analysis of VHDL. You do not need to be a programmer to help, it is even more helpful to interpret and clarify the VHDL standard and provide minimal examples and describe how they should work according to the standard.

# Projects
## VHDL Language Server
[![vhdl ls crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/vhdl_ls.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/vhdl_ls)
### Goals
- A complete VHDL language server protocol implementation with diagnostics, navigate to symbol, find all references etc.

### Features
- Live syntax and type checking 
- Checks for missing and duplicate declarations
- Supports goto-definition/declaration (also in presence of overloading)
- Supports find-references (also in presence of overloading)
- Supports goto-implementation
  - From component declaration to matching entity by default binding
  - From entity to matching component declaration by default binding
- Supports hovering symbols
- Rename symbol
- Find workspace symbols
- View/find document symbols



## Trying it out
A language server is never used directly by the end user and it is integrated into different editor plugins. The ones I know about are listed here.

## Use in VSCode
https://github.com/Bochlin/rust_hdl_vscode

## Use in emacs
VHDL LS has built-in support by emacs `lsp-mode` since 2020-01-04.

It can be set up automatically by installing the package
[`vhdl-ext`](https://github.com/gmlarumbe/vhdl-ext/) and adding the
following snippet to your config:

```elisp
(require 'vhdl-ext)
(vhdl-ext-mode-setup)
(vhdl-ext-eglot-set-server 've-rust-hdl) ;`eglot' config
(vhdl-ext-lsp-set-server 've-rust-hdl)   ; `lsp' config
```

### Configuration
The language server needs to know your library mapping to perform full analysis of the code. For this it uses a configuration file in the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format named `vhdl_ls.toml`.

`vhdl_ls` will load configuration files in the following order of priority (first to last):
1. A file named `.vhdl_ls.toml` in the user home folder.
2. A file name from the `VHDL_LS_CONFIG` environment variable.
3. A file named `vhdl_ls.toml` in the workspace root.

Settings in a later files overwrites those from previously loaded files.

**Example vhdl_ls.toml**

```toml
# File names are either absolute or relative to the parent folder of the vhdl_ls.toml file
[libraries]
lib2.files = [
  'pkg2.vhd',
]
lib1.files = [
  'pkg1.vhd',
  'tb_ent.vhd'
]

# Wildcards are supported
lib3.files = [
  'test/*.vhd',
  'src/*.vhd',
  'src/*/*.vhd',
]

# Libraries can be marked as third-party to disable some analysis warnings, such as unused declarations
UNISIM.files = [
  'C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2023.1\data\vhdl\src\unisims\unisim_VCOMP.vhd',
]
UNISIM.is_third_party = true
```

## As an LSP-client developer how should I integrate VHDL-LS?
I recommend that the `lsp-client` polls GitHub and downloads the [latest](https://github.com/VHDL-LS/rust_hdl/releases/latest) VHDL-LS release from GitHub.

VHDL-LS has frequent releases and the automatic update ensures minimal maintenance for the `lsp-client` developer as well as ensuring the users are not running and outdated version.

## VHDL Language Frontend
[![vhdl language frontend crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/vhdl_lang.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/vhdl_lang)
### Goals
- This project aims to provide a fully featured open source VHDL frontend that is easy to integrate into other tools.
- A design goal of the frontend is to be able to recover from syntax errors such that it is useful for building a language server.
- Analysis order must be automatically computed such that the user does not have to maintain a compile order.
- Comments will be part of the AST to support document generation.
- Separate parsing from semantic analysis to allow code formatting on non-semantically correct code.
